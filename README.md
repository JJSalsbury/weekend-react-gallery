# WEEKEND REACT GALLERY

## Description

_Duration: MARCH 24-27th_

I was asked to create an application that displayed a gallery page to share pictures of things that are important to me. 

Visitors can click on an image to see an image description and click a button to "like" an image.

I was introduced to REACT on Monday. By Thursday, that same week I was working on this project. Developing the project started with thoughtful and intentional preplanning, which made the execution of the project much easier. I developed a solid plan.

I practiced passing values through props in React and built the gallery using multiple components; an App, GalleryList, and GalleryItem.

Passing data through props requires a bit of meticulousness. You must add them when being called and a small spelling or capitalization  error can definitely be hard to identify quickly.

Also, in react, the component parent child relationship was initially hard for me to conceive, but this work really helped solidify the relationship in regards to passing values.


Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.


1. Open up code editor, run an `npm install`
2. Running the server code requires nodemon. If you don't already have nodemon, install it globally with npm install nodemon --global.
3. Run `npm run server` in your terminal.
4. Run `npm run client` in your terminal.
5. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
