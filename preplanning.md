**JJ's Project Preplanning:**

# Weekend Project.
# The Fullstack To-Do App. 
​
## To Do
​
[x] Power on laptop.   
[x] Install npm libraries, as needed needed. 
    [x] express, pg. 
//[x] Create Pool.// (take out) 
​
### Database
​
- no data base requirements.  
- data stored in array (galleryItems) on server.  
​
### Server/Router & ROUTE Considerations

​1. Server/Router 
[x]  server/router provided.  
[x]  server (gallery.data.js).
    [] Express Routes:
        [] /gallery (PROVIDED)
[x]  router (gallery.route.js). 
    [] PUT ROUTES:
        [] /like/:id (PROVIDED)
        [] /


### DOM
[x] create a gallery page to share pictures of things that are important to you 

## Requirements:  

[x] Create a button to "like" an image.  

[x] Images don't need to be 100px x 100px, but it will be easier if the are all the same dimensions.   


### Client (React)

Build the gallery using multiple components. !!Remember JJ!!... its all Functional Programming.

## Components:

# App - represents the overall application or site.
    [ ] import
        [ ] React imports 
            [ ] State  
            [ ] Effect
        [ ] axios
        [ ] hooks:
            [ ] useState  

    [] function App
        [x] (No form component necessary. Include in App.js as part of the function.)
        [] Create State Variables for user input
        [] Create function handleSubmit
        [] Return:
            []
            []
            [] Axios:   
                [ ] 
            
 
# GalleryList - represents the gallery of images. We could reuse this component in different applications.  

    [] import any required components.  

    [] function StudentList  
        [] 
        []
        [] Route Considerations:    
            []

    [] export to any required component.  

# GalleryItem - represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to click the image to toggle between image and description as well as the ability to like an image.  

    [] import any required components.  

    [] function StudentItem  
        []  
        []  
        [] Route Considerations:    
            []


    [] export to any required components.
