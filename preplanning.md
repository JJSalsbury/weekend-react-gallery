# Weekend Project.
# The Fullstack To-Do App. 
​
## To Do
​
[x] Power on laptop.   
[x] Install npm libraries, as needed needed. 
    [x] express, pg. 
//[x] Create Pool.// (take out) 
​
### Database
​
- no data base requirements.  
- data stored in array (galleryItems) on server.  
​
### Server/Router
​1. Server/Router 
[x]  server/router provided.  
[x]  server (gallery.data.js).  
[x]  router (gallery.route.js).  


### DOM
[x] create a gallery page to share pictures of things that are important to you 

## Requirements:  

[x] Create a button to "like" an image.  

[x] Images don't need to be 100px x 100px, but it will be easier if the are all the same dimensions.   


### Client (React)

Build the gallery using multiple components. !!Remember JJ!!... its all Functional Programming.

## Components:

# App - represents the overall application or site.
    [] import
        [] React imports 
            [] State  
            [] Effect
        [] axios

        [] function App:
            [] No form component necessary. Include in App.js as part of the function.
            [] return considerations:
                []
                []
                [] Route Considerations:   
                    []
            
 
# GalleryList - represents the gallery of images. We could reuse this component in different applications.  

    [] import any required components.  

    [] function StudentList  
        [] 
        []
        [] Route Considerations:    
            []

    [] export to any required component.  

# GalleryItem - represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to click the image to toggle between image and description as well as the ability to like an image.  

    [] import any required components.  

    [] function StudentItem  
        []  
        []  
        [] Route Considerations:    
            []


    [] export to any required components.
